Industries included in this dataset vary from location to location. In as many locations as possible, five specific industry segments are consistently present (Construction, Manufacturing, Retail Trade, All Industries, Total Government) as well as the largest 3 out of the remaining segments for that location. Not every location has data for every segment, and some may not have data for the five consistently reported segments. This data is from the Connecticut Department of Labor Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW). The program produces a comprehensive tabulation of employment and wage information for workers covered by Connecticut Unemployment Insurance (UI) laws and Federal workers covered by the Unemployment Compensation for Federal Employees (UCFE) program.",
